    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>

    <p>This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to be a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that it can be 
        devoured alone! You can use any sort of topping variation. The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.</p>

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tortilla: Use store-bought or homemade soft flour tortillas.</li>
            <li>Oil: Brush the tortillas with olive oil before you season them.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: These tortilla pizzas are seasoned with garlic powder, black pepper, and dried oregano.</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce: Use store-bought or homemade tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Toppings: Top the tortilla pizzas with sliced chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions. 
                Of course, you can customize the toppings to suit your taste. </li>
            <li>Cheese: Finish the pizzas with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        </ul>
